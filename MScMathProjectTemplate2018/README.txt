-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage details

Thesis information such as title, author, year, degree, etc., and other meta-data can be modified in `thesis-info.tex`

### Class Options

The class file, "UCMScThesis", is based on the standard `book`
class

It supports the following custom options in the documentclass in thesis.tex:

(Usage `\documentclass[a4paper,11pt,print]{Classes/UCMScThesis}`)

*   `a4paper` (default as per the Universities instructions) or `a5paper`: Paper size

*   `11pt` or `12pt`: We recommend using a font size of 11pt and 10pt for footnotes.

*   `oneside` or `twoside` (default): This is especially useful for printing double side (twoside) or single side.

*   `print`: Supports Print and Online Version with different page margins and hyperlink styles.
    Use `print` in the options to activate Print Version with appropriate margins and page layout and view styles.
    Leaving the options field blank will activate Online version.

*   `custommargin`: You can alter the margin dimension for both print and online version by using the keyword `custommargin` in the options. Then you can define the dimensions of the margin in the `preamble.tex` file:

        \ifsetMargin
        \else
        \RequirePackage[left=28mm,right=28mm,top=35mm,bottom=30mm]{geometry}
        \setFancyHdr
        \fi
    `\setFancyHdr` should be called when using custom margins for proper header/footer dimensions

*   `langen`: This redefines the style to English language if the MSc Thesis is written in English.
      The default language is Portuguese. In this case of using Portuguese there is no need to declare it.

*   `index`: Including this option builds the index, which is placed at the end of the thesis.

    Instructions on how to use the index can be found [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Using_makeidx).

    _Note_: the package `makeidx` is used to create the index.

*   `abstract`: This option enables only the thesis title page and the abstract with title and author to be printed.

*   `chapter`: This option enables only the specified chapter and it's references. Useful for review and corrections.


### Abstract separate

*  A separate abstract with the title of the PhD and the candidate name has to be submitted to the Student Registry. This can be generated using `abstract` option in the document class. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file:

        \ifdefineAbstract
        \includeonly{Abstract/abstract}
        \else
        \fi

### Chapter Mode

*  The chapter mode allows user to only print specific chapters along with references. By default, it excludes everything else in the front matter and appendices. This can done by using `chapter` option in the document class in `thesis.tex`. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file:

		\ifdefineChapter
			\includeonly{Chapter3/chapter3}
		\else
		\fi


### Choosing the Fonts

"UCMScThesis" currently supports three fonts `Times`, `Fourier` and
`Latin Modern (default)`.

*   `times`: (we recommend using Times). Specifying times option in the document class will use `mathptpx` or `Times` font with Math Support.
*   `fourier`: fourier font with math support
*   `default (empty)`: When no font is specified, `Latin Modern` is used as the default font with Math Support.
*   `customfont`: Any custom font can be set in preamble by using `customfont` option in the document class. Then the custom font can be loaded in preamble.tex in the line:

		\ifsetFont
		\else
		\RequirePackage{Your_Custom_Font}
		\fi

### Choosing the Bibliography style

"UCMScThesis" currently supports two styles `authoryear` and
`numbered (default)`. Citation style has to be set. You can also
specify `custombib` style and customise the bibliography.

* `authoryear`: For author-year citation eg., Krishna (2013)

* `numbered`: (Default Option) For numbered and sorted citation e.g., [1,5,2]

* `custombib`: Define your own bibliography style in the `preamble.tex` file.

		\RequirePackage[square, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

* (Overview of Bibtex-Styles with preview)[http://nodonn.tipido.net/bibstyle.php?]

* If you would like to use biblatex instead of natbib. Pass the option `custombib` in the documentclass. In the `preamble.tex` file, edit the custombib section. Make sure you don't load the natbib package and you can specify the layout of your references in `thesis.tex` in the reference section. If you are using `biber` as backend, run `pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex >> biber thesis >> pdflatex thesis.tex`. If you are using the default natbib package, don't worry about this.

### Choosing the Page Style

"UCMScThesis" defines 3 different page styles (header and footer).
The following definition is for `twoside` layout.

* `default (leave empty)`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name in Header (Right Even) and Section #. Section Name (Left Odd). Blank Footer.

        Header (Even)   : 4                                                 Introduction

        Header (Odd)    : 1.2 Section Name 		   			                5

        Footer 		    : Empty

* `PageStyleI`: For Page Numbers in Header (Left Even, Right Odd) and Chapter Name next to the Page Number on Even Side (Left Even). Section Number and Section Name and Page Number in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Footer is empty. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : 4 | Introduction

        Header (Odd)    :                         			                1.2 Section Name | 5

        Footer 		    :                               Empty

* `PageStyleII`: Chapter Name on Even Side (Left Even) in Header. Section Number and Section Name in Header on Odd Side (Right Odd). Page numbering in footer. Layout:

        Header (Even)   : Introduction

        Header (Odd)    : 			   				                        1.2 Section Name

        Footer[centered]:                           	3

### Changing the visual style of chapter headings

The visual style of chapter headings can be modified using the `titlesec` package. Edit the following lines in the `preamble.tex` file.

        \RequirePackage{titlesec}
        \newcommand{\PreContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\Large}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}
        {1ex}{}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\ContentTitleFormat}{\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\scshape\huge}
        {\Large\filleft{\chaptertitlename} \Huge\thechapter}{1ex}
        {\titlerule\vspace{1ex}\filright}
        [\vspace{1ex}\titlerule]}
        \newcommand{\PostContentTitleFormat}{\PreContentTitleFormat}
        \PreContentTitleFormat

### Custom Settings

*   The depth for the table of contents can be set using:

        \setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
	    \setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
    A depth of [3] indicates to a level of `\subsubsection` or #.#.#.#. Default set as 2.

*   To hide sections from appearing in TOC use: `\tochide\section{Section name}` in your TeX files

*   Define custom caption style for figure and table caption in `preamble.tex` using:

        \RequirePackage[small,bf,figurename=Fig.,labelsep=space,tableposition=top]{caption}

*   Bibliography with Author-Year Citation in `preamble.tex`:
	
        \RequirePackage[round, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

## General guidelines

*   To restrict the length of the figure caption in List of figures use a \[short-title\] and {longtitle} for the caption or the section:

		`\caption[Caption that you want to appear in TOC]{Actual caption of the figure}`
		`\section[short]{title}`

*   To exclude sections from being numbered and disable it from appearing in the Table of Contents use \section*{Section_Name} or \chapter*{Chapter_Name}

*   To only exclude it from being listed in the Table of Contents encapsulate the section command inside the `\tochide` command. `\tochide{\section{Section_Name}}` the section will not appear in the Table of Contents, but the section will be numbered.

*   When including figures in your tex file, it's a good practice to size your picture depending on the page size, instead of using absolute values. In the following example `0.75\textwidth` refers to picture width being set to 75% of the text width.

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{minion}

*   Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes, eg., `g-pi` dentes the Greek symbol `pi`.
